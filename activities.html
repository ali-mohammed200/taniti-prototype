                        <span>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and visit the
                            volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum,
                            going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several
                            pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking
                            helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a
                            nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are in
                            Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.
