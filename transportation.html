                                that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small
                                airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process
                                of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the
                                next few years. </span>

                                Taniti City is flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding
                                Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
